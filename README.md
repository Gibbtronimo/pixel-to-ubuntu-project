# Create a Custom Kernel for Google Pixel 2XL

This repository is being used to document my journey in creating a custom android kernel for the Pixel.
I chose the Pixel because it was readily available to me as a device.

## Long term goals

- custom kernel as to "de-google" the phone
- integrate linux-stable into the kernel to create a mobile hackstation
